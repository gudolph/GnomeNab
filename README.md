#Gnab the Nome!

##The task for this project was to create a simple addition game.  The objective is to reach a target number without going over that is randomly generated by the site.  To add values, four gnome sprites are generated each with a random value associated with it.
##If you are able to successfully hit the target, a win is tallied and the page can be restarted for a new set of variables.  If the player doesn't succeed a loss is tallied instead.
